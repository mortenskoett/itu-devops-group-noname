## 3.01 Stages and Tools used for CI/CD chain
<!-- 
NOTES FROM SESSION 4
In this session we implement a continuous integration (CI) chain using the following technologies and tools:
- the distributed version control system (VCS) Git (https://git-scm.com) and GitHub (https://github.com) as host,
- the build server service Travis CI (https://travis-ci.com/),
    - Why did we choose CircleCI over Travis or Github Actions?
    - Why choose CI/CD as a service vs. self-hosted like Jenkins (most often in bigger organizations and companies)?
- Docker containers (https://www.docker.com) and DockerHub (https://hub.docker.com) as a public registry,
- Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com) to setup and manage virtual remote machines
- and the cloud server provider Digital Ocean (https://www.digitalocean.com).

Tasks:
- **OBS MSc students:** Remember to log and provide good arguments for the choice of CI/CD system, i.e., why do you choose your solution instead of any other?

- You choose freely if you want to go for continuous delivery or continuous deployment. x
- Let your build pipeline contain not only building your application but also execution of your test suite and other appropriate build stages. x

### Continious integration and delivery
This section describes the continous integration and continous delivery (CI/CD) chain of our system. We have chosen continious delivery and not continous deployment in the sense that in order to start the deployment of our code we have to push to the release branch. Pushing to the release branch requires a code review from two other members of the team. See [section 3.02](../chapters/302_repo_and_branch_strategy.md).  

Therefore deployments do not happen automatically every time a new change is made and potentially deployable code is not always deployed.

The reason for choosing continous delivery over continous deployment was that we wanted a thorough review of the code before it was deployed and released to reduce the risk of the system crashing in production.

An alternative to this could be to have a more exhaustive test suite so that we would be fairly certain the code was ready to be deployed if it passed the tests. This is described further in [section 4.00](../chapters/400_lessons_learned_perspective.md) -->

### Services
For our CI/CD chain, we are using Vagrant and CircleCI.
We use *Vagrant* to start a droplet on DigitalOcean (DO). By installing Vagrant, we can write a Vagrant file specifying what server and installations we want (declaring that we are using DO, where to find our credentials, and what server and images we want it to create), and then make Vagrant set up the desired server on our DO account. Instead of relying on Vagrant, we could create and configure a droplet manually (using the DO website or the terminal), but it is better to have the exact setup and configuration written down as code, so that we can easily redo it again later - this is what Vagrant helps us to do.

**Write something about why choosing CircleCI over Travis**
We use *CircleCI*, which provides CI/CD as a service, to automate testing of our code and deployment to DO. We have set up a service on CircleCI, which listens on our different branches on GitHub.

When we push new commits to any git branch, CircleCI will fetch our code from Github and run our tests. If the tests fail we will be notified with an e-mail. Further, on Github each branch is marked with a checkmark or a cross indicating whether the code has passed the tests.

### Deployment
We start the deployment of our code by merging into to the release branch. The below activity diagram illustrates the activities for CircleCI in our deployment chain.

Stages used for our CI chain:
- Push code to the release branch
- CircleCI fetches the code from GitHub and runs our test script
    - If the tests fail, we are notified and no further actions are made
- CircleCI pushes the docker images to DockerHub
- CircleCI runs our deploy script, which deploys our code to our Digital Ocean server

The diagram below gives an overview of the services involved in our deployment chain and the steps described above:

The tests run by CircleCI consist of an Eslint check and some tests for our API. Eslint is a linter for JavaScript code, which ensures that we keep a code standard. Eslint can be run locally and even integrated into the IDE so that errors can be found locally before the tests are run on the CircleCI server. 

The tests for the API are not very extensive but they ensure that the system can be build and responds to requests.
