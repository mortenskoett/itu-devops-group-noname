# 1 Preface and Introduction

## Preface
As part of the course *'DevOps, Software Evolution and Software Maintenance, BSc + MSc'* (in short DevOps course) we, a team of five computer science master students were tasked to convert an existing legacy software system called ITU-MiniTwit. The system is essentially a Twitter clone in the form of a messageboard, where signed-up users can publish small text, follow/unfollow and enjoy the freeflow of internet communication.

The old system showed signs of decay, slow access, unable to handle the increasing amount of connections and not to forget the security and hassles of maintaining software versions, well past their end-of-life cycle. Something had to be done.

## Introduction
And this is where the DevOps course begins; first by forming a group of five students, and then as the couse progress we were being tasked with conversion, development, operation and maintenance of a actively used system, which was simulated by ghost users, making use of our system through an API.

So even if our system have only lived for a few months, the experience of having to accommodate the demands of stakeholders (teachers and teaching assistents) and needs of users has been very real, with the focus of building a dependable system that is maintainable and scalable without disrupting active users from using the system.

This report will be a view into our work, both the project and as a *devops* group, the thoughts, the troubles and the 20/20 hindsight of knowing what we should have done instead. And maybe also few things related to how a global pandemic intervene with everyday life.
